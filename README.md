  ## Description
  Vote It is the easiest way to manage your custom polls. It allows you to upload images for polls such as sweater contests, or onto vote on various dishes that were cooked. You can name your poll, and each of the options, and allow all of your guests to vote, or just leave the poll open to the general public.
